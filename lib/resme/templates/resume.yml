# first the list of mother tongues and then all the other languages
# you have some profiency with.
#
# For the proficiency level, you can use the "level" keyword, whose
# value is a string (e.g., "EXCELLENT", "INTERMEDIATE").  The level is
# outputted in the markdown and json templates.
#
# The Europass format requires to specify more information, that is,
# your proficiency in five different areas.  Profiency is from A1 to
# C2; the areas include understanding, speaking, writing. See the
# documentation of the Europass format for more details.
